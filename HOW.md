This site started with a [conversation](https://grok.com/chat/f5247e82-0080-4efa-a57c-bf4eeffc7458) with [grok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok_(chatbot)) to use Soljenitzine's address as a way to better my russina.


I realized that could be a starting point for a project of space repetition
learning. So I decided to process the html of that conversation both manually
and by script written with the help of [augment](https://www.augmentcode.com/)
used as a vscode extension.
