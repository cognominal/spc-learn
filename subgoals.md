# Subgoals

I got up to a relatively sane state with a lot of code produced
by augment which help to develop from a semi real example, the
Soljenitzine's address. This list should help to go forward.


* [ ] space repetition learning (the big item )
* [x] a cleant up [raw-file-from-grok.html](static/raw-file-from-grok.html)
* [ ] general UI
  * [ ] an github icon, which points to the sources
  * [ ] So many things to be defined
  * [ ] a route for the 1000 more common words grouped by their non inflexion form. Need to find example.
* [ ] text panel
  * [ ] better representation
    * [ ] only english translation for the current sentence. Some faulty logic there 
  * [ ] hovering a word should higlight the word and its translation
    * [ ] highlighting of rare words (using data-rare)
    * [ ] using it for a teacher mode. The teacher should click a word then its translation so that hover one highlights the other
* [ ] definition panel
   * [ ] clicking on a word should produce its definition. It worked, now broken
   * [ ] it should also show the non inflexed form
* [ ] using a ts adapter to sqlite
* [ ] some logic to support many documents and their translation. How to ask grok to produce
* [ ] a list of documents. Little prince comess to mind. And some Poutine, Lavrov addresses, but that's my bias.
* [ ] Using AI. I am using AI to produce the code. But AI should be used to learn russian as well. How ?
